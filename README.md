This is about lifelong leaner sharings, ecpacially data science

I have started to learn Python for Data Science via Appdataquest (https://app.dataquest.io/dashboard). I find it helpful and easy to learn and practice. Although,  this site is not fully free (Freemium concept you know), work a lot for me. Real word example projects are exiting enough to finish course. Nevertheles, this program is self-paced which encourages keep learning anywhere and anytime.
